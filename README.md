## User Stories

Don't know what to drink with what you have laying around the house? That's the point of our app.

Users can add and favorite recipes already supplied.

Can search based off of ingredients or even glass type.

Wanted to keep UX very straight forward and simple. 

## Problem and Approach

We started our app with looking for an API to base it off of and utilize. We wanted it to be fully encorporated and be able to manipulate the data as we saw fit.

Along the way we decided to also add to it and keep our own version of inputs and index it based off of user profiles. Which turned into a "favorites" for the users. 

## Work Flow and Organization

We initially decided to use trello and keep track of the tasks that needed to be tackled and just went at it. 

The way we seperated work was to discuss what we would be working on per day that we met and continue the flow until down, staying in constant communication and updating if something went wrong. 

We kept a schedule and attempted to meet at roughly the same time per day to keep on task and make sure we had a steady flow of progress.
